## Overview

Users are able to: 

- Make calculations 
- See hover states for all the buttons
- Delete and clear display
- Use decimal numbers 

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## Updates
I added a sound effect to the calculator keys to give a more real feel by implemeting a function, and calling it using the event attribute "onclick" in HTML.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JavaScript



### What I learned

Thanks to this tutorial I've got a better understanding of the JavaScript logic and how to apply it when writing your own functions to build an app
