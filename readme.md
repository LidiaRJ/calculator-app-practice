## Updates
I added a sound effect to the calculator keys to give a more real feel by implemeting a function, and calling it using the event attribute "onclick" in HTML.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JavaScript



### What I learned

Thanks to this tutorial I've got a better understanding of the JavaScript logic and how to apply it when writing your own functions to build an app
